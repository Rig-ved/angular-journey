        <p>
          This is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. When you
          share information
          with us, we can make our services even better for you. For instance, we can show you more relevant search
          results, help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our
          services, we want you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in which you can protect your
          privacy. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. Remember, you can find controls
          to manage your information and protect your privacy and security. Weâ€™ve tried to keep it as simple as
          possible.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Right To Access, Correct, and Delete Data</h3>
        <p>
          Our members have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and to object to the
          processing
          of such data, by managing their profile. We make every effort to put in place suitable precautions to
          safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being altered, corrupted,
          destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, we do not control each and every risk related
          to the use of the Internet, and therefore warn the users of the potential risks involved in the functioning
          and use of the Internet. We may include links to other web sites or other internet sources. We cannot
          control these web sites and external sources, therefore cannot be held responsible for the provision
          or display of these web sites and external sources, and may not be held liable for the content, advertising,
          products, services or any other material available on or from these web sites or external sources.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          Our site collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. You
          provide some of
          this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you
          interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports
          or GPS location of your device.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>
          Our web site uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate this site and provide (including
          improving and
          personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications, including promotional communications, and
          to display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various
          web site services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However,
          to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain
          data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed
          in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address
          or phone number.
